     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=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

     ```

3. **Redeploy** (3 min)
   - Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Click latest ‚Üí ... menu ‚Üí Redeploy

## üîç Verify Your Fix

### Check 1: Vercel Logs
```
Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí [Latest Deployment] ‚Üí Logs
Search for: [Google Auth]

Expected to see:
[Google Auth] GET callback received
[Google Auth] Processing authorization code...
[Google Auth] Exchanging authorization code for tokens...
[Google Auth] Successfully exchanged code for tokens
```

### Check 2: Manual Test
```
https://samarpan-mu.vercel.app/login ‚Üí Click "Sign in with Google" ‚Üí Select account
Result: Should redirect to dashboard (not error page)
```

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Still Getting "Failed to exchange authorization code"?

**1. Check Redirect URI Mismatch**
```
Error: "The redirect_uri parameter does not match"
‚Üí Solution: Verify Google Cloud Console has EXACTLY:
   https://samarpan-mu.vercel.app/api/auth/google/callback
   (Note: case-sensitive, no trailing slash)
```

**2. Check Missing Environment Variables**
```
Vercel logs show: "Client ID: MISSING" or "Client Secret: MISSING"
‚Üí Solution: 
   - Verify env vars are set in Vercel Dashboard
   - Ensure ALL THREE environments are checked (Production ‚úì Preview ‚úì Development ‚úì)
   - Redeploy after adding variables
```

**3. Check Stale Deployment**
```
Env vars were updated but Vercel still using old code
‚Üí Solution: 
   - Click Redeploy in Vercel Dashboard
   - Or push a commit: git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger redeploy" && git push
```

**4. Test Locally First**
```bash
# Create .env.local with same credentials
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000/login
# If local works but production doesn't ‚Üí issue is Vercel config
# If local fails too ‚Üí credentials are wrong or Google Cloud needs update
```

## üí° What Was Fixed in the Code

The production deployment now:

‚úÖ **Dynamically detects the domain** (localhost, vercel.app, etc.)
‚úÖ **No longer relies on hardcoded environment variables** for redirects
‚úÖ **Provides detailed error logs** showing exactly what redirect URI was used
‚úÖ **Works on any deployment domain** without code changes

**Before:** Redirect URI had to be manually configured per environment
**After:** Automatically uses the current request domain

---

## üîê Security Reminders

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit `.env.local` with real credentials to Git
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` private (only in environment variables)
- ‚úÖ Use separate OAuth credentials for production vs development
- ‚úÖ Rotate credentials every 90 days

## üìû Need Help?

1. **Read the detailed guides:**
   - `VERCEL_OAUTH_SETUP.md` for setup help
   - `GOOGLE_OAUTH_FIX.md` for troubleshooting

2. **Check Vercel logs:**
   - Look for `[Google Auth]` messages
   - They'll tell you exactly what's failing

3. **Verify Google Cloud Console:**
   - Redirect URI must match exactly
   - Don't forget `https://` (not just `http://`)

## ‚ú® Testing Checklist

After applying the fix, verify:

- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel (all 3 environments)
- [ ] Google Cloud Console has production redirect URI registered
- [ ] Vercel deployment completed (Deployments ‚Üí shows completion)
- [ ] Vercel logs show `[Google Auth] Successfully exchanged code for tokens`
- [ ] Production login works: https://samarpan-mu.vercel.app/login
- [ ] User can see dashboard after Google sign-in
- [ ] User can refresh page and still be logged in (token persists)

---

**Expected completion time: 15-20 minutes total**

After Vercel redeploys, the fix takes effect immediately. No additional server restart needed.
