# Route Protection Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the routing protection mechanism implemented to prevent logged-in users from accessing login/signup pages.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Middleware Layer (`middleware.ts`)
**File:** `c:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Documents\Samarpan\samarpan\middleware.ts`

The Next.js middleware now enforces route protection at the server level:

- **Authentication Routes (`/login`, `/signup`):**
  - If user has a valid `token` cookie, redirect to `/dashboard`
  - Only unauthenticated users can access these pages

- **Admin Authentication Routes (`/admin/login`):**
  - If admin has a valid `adminToken` cookie, redirect to `/admin`
  - Only unauthenticated admins can access this page

- **Protected Routes (`/dashboard`, `/profile`):**
  - Requires valid `token` cookie
  - Unauthenticated users redirected to `/login`

- **Admin Routes (`/admin`):**
  - Requires valid `adminToken` cookie
  - Unauthenticated admins redirected to `/admin/login`

**Matcher Configuration:**
```
["/dashboard/:path*", "/profile/:path*", "/admin/:path*", "/login/:path*", "/signup/:path*", "/admin/login/:path*"]
```

### 2. Client-Side Protection (User Login)
**File:** `c:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Documents\Samarpan\samarpan\app\(public)\login\page.tsx`

- Checks Redux state for existing `token`
- If token exists and loading is complete, redirects to `/dashboard`
- Prevents users from seeing login page if already authenticated

### 3. Client-Side Protection (User Signup)
**File:** `c:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Documents\Samarpan\samarpan\app\(public)\signup\page.tsx`

- Checks Redux state for existing `token` before signup
- If already authenticated, redirects to `/dashboard`
- After successful signup, checks for authentication and redirects

### 4. Client-Side Protection (Admin Login)
**File:** `c:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Documents\Samarpan\samarpan\app\admin\login\page.tsx`

- Checks localStorage for `adminToken` on component mount
- If token exists, redirects to `/admin` panel
- Uses useEffect with proper cleanup

### 5. Logout Mechanism
**File:** `c:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Documents\Samarpan\samarpan\lib\slices\authSlice.ts`

The logout action:
1. Clears Redux state (`token`, `isAuthenticated`)
2. Removes localStorage items (`token`, `user`)
3. Calls `/api/auth/logout` to clear cookies
4. User can then access login/signup pages again

**Logout UI:**
- Located in user dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Red destructive button with logout icon
- Calls `handleLogout()` which dispatches logout action
- Redirects to home page after logout

## User Flows

### Successful Authentication Flow
```
User on /login → Submit credentials → API validates → Token created
→ Redux state updated → Client redirected to /dashboard
→ Next access to /login → Middleware detects token → Redirect to /dashboard
```

### Logout Flow
```
User on /dashboard → Click Logout button → Redux logout action
→ Clear localStorage & state → Clear cookies → Redirect to /
→ User can now access /login page again
```

### Attempting to Access Login While Authenticated
```
User with valid token → Navigate to /login
→ Middleware detects token → Redirect to /dashboard (server-side)
OR
Client-side useEffect → Detects token → Redirect to /dashboard
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Storage:**
   - User tokens: localStorage (Redux synced)
   - Admin tokens: localStorage
   - Cookies set by API for additional security

2. **Protected Routes:**
   - Middleware provides server-side protection
   - Client-side checks provide UX optimization
   - Double protection ensures no gaps

3. **Logout:**
   - Complete state clearing
   - All storage removed
   - API endpoint clears server-side sessions

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login as user → Attempt to access /login → Should redirect to /dashboard
- [ ] Login as user → Attempt to access /signup → Should redirect to /dashboard
- [ ] Login as admin → Attempt to access /admin/login → Should redirect to /admin
- [ ] Click Logout → Redirected to home
- [ ] After logout, access /login → Should load login page normally
- [ ] Protected route /dashboard without auth → Should redirect to /login
- [ ] Protected route /admin without auth → Should redirect to /admin/login

## Files Modified

1. `middleware.ts` - Added route protection logic
2. `app/(public)/login/page.tsx` - Added pre-authentication check
3. `app/(public)/signup/page.tsx` - Added pre-authentication checks
4. `app/admin/login/page.tsx` - Added pre-authentication check
